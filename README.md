# US-CPI-relative-importance-coefficient-weights

The BLS data is a bit confusing in its setup when i was trying to calculate historical cumulatives for major cpi categories. 

There isnt much online so i wrote a few lines to navigate through the data. Didnt include any error handling so please play with care.
